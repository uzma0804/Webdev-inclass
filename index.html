<!DOCTYPE html> <!--DOCTYPE is a declaration, not a tag. Says it is using HTML-->

<!--HTML is the structure and content of a webpage. It stands for HyperText Markup language. A mark up language is not a programming language. Resource to get help: Mozilla Developer Network (MDN).
    The general rule : <opening tag> Some content <closing tag>-->

<!--Block level elements: Each one gets their own line. Examples include: <h1> to <h6>, <p>, <div>, <form>-->
<!--Inline elements-- Each one does not get their own line.  Examples include: <b>, <strong>, <i>, <em>, <a>-->  
    
<!--Divs and Spans: Both allows you to group contents in your webpage together.
* <div> content goes here </div>: Is a generic container and can group things together (Is a block level element)
*<span> some text </span>: Also a container but is an in-line element. For example: I dance for no reason. You want to make the word dance bold and red. So, all you will have to do is have the "dance" part inside a span tag and then add styling to that span to make it bold and red. Cannot do this with div, as div will push the word "dance" in a another line since div is a block level element.-->

<!--In-line CSS stuff-->

<!--CSS: Cascading Style Sheets. Sheets bacause we are going to write these seperately from our HTML. They are not inside the HTML. They are seperate documents that we then include in our HTML

Check out: CSS Zen Garden

The General Rule: 
selector{
    property: value;
    anotherProperty: value;
    yetAnotherProperty: value;
}

"selector" selects from the existing HTML elements in our page.

You can add CSS styling in three ways:

1. Inline (traditional way of doing it)
    <h3 style='color: pink;'> Hi there! </h3>

2. Style Tag (nested) {not ideal}
    <html>
        <head>
            <title>This is nested style tag demo</title>
            <style type="text/css">
                p{
                    color:red;
                }
                
            </style>

3. Seperate CSS files using the <link> tag:

    <!DOCTYPE html>
            <head>
                <title>This is to show how to link a seperate CSS file </title>
       ****     <link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="style.css">    ****
            </head>   
    </html>
